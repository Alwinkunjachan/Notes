Cassandra 
--------------

Keyspace: Like a database, contains tables
Table:	Contains rows, each row is made of columns
Partition Key: Determines which node stores the row and groups data in a partition
Clustering Key:	Determines how data is sorted within the partition
Same Partition Key Stored on the same node (same partition)
Same Clustering Key	Not grouped together unless partition key is also the same
Inside a partiion the clustering keys are unique
Primary Key	Combination of partition key and clustering key(s)
Clustering keys are optional partition keys are must.
Datas are stored in the same node according to the partition key
Row = Identified uniquely by the Primary Key.
Primary Key = Partition Key + (optional) Clustering Key(s).
Partition Key → Decides which node stores the row.
Clustering Key → Orders rows inside a partition.
